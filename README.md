# monte-carlo-option-pricing

This project implements a high-performance Monte Carlo simulator in C++ for pricing European and American options. It models stock prices using Geometric Brownian Motion, applies variance reduction techniques, and uses the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm to value early exercise opportunities.

## Features
- European & American options
- Multithreaded simulation
- Variance reduction (antithetic/control)
- Longstaff-Schwartz regression
- pybind11 interface (coming soon)
